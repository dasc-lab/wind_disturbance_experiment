    "In this tutorial, we'll work through an example problem in Gaussian process (GP) regression using Python.\n",
    "The goal of the tutorial is to give you a qualitative sense of how GP regression works and a rough idea of how you might implement it in a real world problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is designed to be open-ended and the last sections should be instructive even if you're already familiar with the implementation of GPs.\n",
    "I've chosen to use Python because it is my programming language of choice and because it is commonly used in astronomy, but if you don't have experience coding in Python I've tried to include a lot of skeleton code so you should still be able to make progress without getting too caught up with Python's syntax.\n",
    "Also, if you ever find yourself writing a `for` loop then something is wrong; Python is an interpreted language and, as a result, looping is *very* slow.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this section, we'll work through how to fit a simplified transit model to data in the presence of \"correlated noise\".\n",
    "I think that it's important to clarify what I mean by \"noise\" here because it isn't necessarily what you immediately expect.\n",
    "When I say noise, I'm referring to *everything that contributes to generating the data that isn't an exoplanet transit*.\n",
    "In the context of transit fitting, this means that everything that the spacecraft is doing (pointing and temperature variations, etc.) and everything that the star is doing (rotation, asteroseismic oscillations, granulation, etc.) is \"noise\".\n",
    "As you can imagine, in many cases this noise might actually be the thing that you're trying to measure and that's fine â€“ I spend most of my time measuring noise!\n",
    "Therefore, more formally, \"noise model\" refers to anything that we're modeling as **stochastic** and the \"mean model\" refers to anything that we're modeling as **deterministic**.\n",
    "For the purposes of this tutorial, we're not going to interpret the stochastic component of the signal and, instead, focus on studying the mean model, but that is not a limitation of GP modeling in general.\n",
